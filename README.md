# ml-zoomcamp

This repository contains my personal notes, code, homework and the other resources for [Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master) course on Machine Learning.

## Prequesties

I use nix to develop and run the code. You can install nix by following the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/download.html).

## Setup

To setup the environment, run the following command:

```bash
nix develop .#ml
```

This will create a shell with all the dependencies installed
